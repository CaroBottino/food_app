# food_app

## Food application

This application is built with Vue.js v2. Just a little brief of my skills for you to know me better.

### Tech stack:

- vue v2
- axios
- vue-router
- simple store
- mockapi backend

\*This app belongs to final project in a course I'm taking. It pretends to keep on growing 🌸

## To interact:

- there's a file in /src/assets/json/items.json with demo info about items for you to create new ones, edit and delete items 😁
- you can register your own user. You'll be buyer by default. You can change yourself to admin.
- Ej user admin: caro@mail.com, caro1234
- Ej user buyer: lu@mail.com, lu1234
